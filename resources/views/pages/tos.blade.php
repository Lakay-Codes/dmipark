                        <h1>DMIpark Nondiscrimination Policy</h1>
                        <p><em>effective as of 10<sup>th</sup> of December 2017</em></p>
                        <p>DMIpark is committed to provide an environment that is free from discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age. Our purpose is to connect people and help build and develop relations based on mutual respect and love. For that purpose we require that both Hosts and Guests demonstrate peace and tolerance in regard to their mutual relationship, and that no decision is based on the factors that are recognized as discriminating factors. All users understand that some distinctions have to be made, whether required so by law or by personal preferences, however in making such distinctions, everyone should endeavor to avoid making exclusions of any kind, as far as possible.</p>
                        <p>DMIpark has the utmost confidence in its users and their tolerance, and is positive that they will not simply comply with this policy, but that they will go above and beyond of what is declared within this document, and prove to the community that both Hosts and Guests are tolerant and loving people, dedicated to showing their hospitality and respect for others.</p>
                        <p>Hosts especially agree that they will not:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decline a Guest based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age;</li>
                            <li>Establish different conditions or change the conditions for Listings based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age;</li>
                            <li>Express either directly or indirectly their preference or disfavor of Guests on account of based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age;</li>
                            <li>Encourage or discourage Guest to book their listings based on their race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Where Hosts share their living space with the guest, Hosts may decline, or impose different terms for Guests of a different gender that that of a Host.</p>
                        <p>Where Guest does not mention their disability Hosts may not inquire about the existence and severity of the disability. If Guest mentions their disability and they find that the accommodation is suitable for them, Hosts may not claim that accommodation is not suitable for that Guest. When Hosts are notified on the potential Guest&rsquo;s disability, they should discuss with the Guest whether the accommodation is suitable for them. Host will not do anything that would worsen the situation a Guest with disability is in, and Host will take all reasonable measures to welcome and to assist a Guest with disability.</p>
                        <p>It will not be considered a discrimination where distinction is made based on a factor that is not recognized under the law as a basis for discrimination. In that sense Host may limit the number of Guest in their accommodation, whether or not they will rent to smokers or pet owners and similar distinctions.</p>
                        <p>Hosts will commit to avoid turning down Guests without appropriate reasons. Hosts may not use appropriate reasons to hide their intention to turn down a Guest based on the discriminatory factor mentioned above. DMIpark may suspend Host&rsquo;s account if we suspect that there is a pattern of turning down Guests belonging to the protected group in a longer period of time.</p>
                        <p>DMIpark may take any reasonable action against Host&rsquo;s which do not comply with this Policy. We may especially (i) ask that Host changes the Listing, (ii) remove the Listing or (iii) suspend Host&rsquo;s account.</p>
